// Section 8- Building a Video Game Discovery App

// Lesson 14- Getting Optimized Images

// From the "image-url" component >-(7)->.- Insert the call to the service "getCroppedImageURL" where
// --- weÂ´re rendering our game image, and pass it the original image as an argument. Save our component
// --- and test it

// LESSON END.- As a side gain from this step, we find that now all images are the same size and uniform
// --- in all game cards, not as before where there were ones larger than others.
// SO, save the changes and commit to git with name "Get Optimized Images"
