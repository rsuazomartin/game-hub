// Section 8- Building a Video Game Discovery App

// Lesson 25- Refactoring- Extracting a Query Object

// 4.- Now we need to apply the same technick in our 'useGames' hook to replace the old state variables
// --- with the new 'gameQuery' query object >-(4)->

// TESTING OUR CHANGES.- Everything is working but the the playstation 'platform' shows nothing no matter 
// --- which genre we choose--- something to investigate

// END OF LESSON.- Commit our code with name "Refactoring: extract a query object"
